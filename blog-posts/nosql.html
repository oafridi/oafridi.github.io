<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Most people are familiar with SQL and have a basic understanding of the various RDBMS out there - Postgres, MySQL, Oracle etc. However recently a newer type of database is becoming popular - NoSQL such as MongoDB, Redis, CoudchDb etc. Taken from Wikipedia NoSQL is defined as: </p>

<p>"A NoSQL (often interpreted as Not Only SQL) database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases."</p>

<h3>SQL vs NoSQL</h3>
<p>A brief comparison of the two types:</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>SQL databases are table based, NoSQL databases are document based</li>
    <li>To query and interact with a SQL db we use SQL (structured query language), to interact with NoSQL we use database-specific syntax.</li>
    <li>SQL dbs have predefined schemas NoSQL dbs do not require them.</li>
    <li>NoSQL can provide benefits over SQL when used for big data in terms of speed and performance</li>
    <li></li>
  
  </ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Any topic concerning technology A vs technology B will always inspire heated debate about which is better. As with most technologies the choice of which type to use is dependent on needs and situation.
