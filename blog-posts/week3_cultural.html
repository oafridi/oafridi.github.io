title: "Mind styles"
---
  <p>So I came across this interesting piece of work by a man named Anthony Gregorc (pictured). Doctor Gregorc is the man behind the theory of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_styles#Anthony_Gregorc.27s_model">Mind Styles model and the Gregorc Style Delineator</a>. Using this you can self score by responding to a set of questions. The scores are mapped onto a graph and the resulting quadrants indicate the style of thinking you are inclined to. My thinking style seems to be a combination of Concrete sequential and Abstract sequential. This indicates I like order, analyzing before making a decision, getting facts and applying logic. All that I would agree with. It also suggests that I may find it hard working with people with different views, not having enough time to deal with a subject thoroughly, repetition and questions with no right or wrong answers. Interestingly I think I would agree most of the assessment. In the context of the boot-camp I'm attending thus far I haven't found anything particularly challenging. So I'm not entirely certain the results presented above are useful in a way that I can act upon them.</p>

  <p>I've also been thinking about the <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">Growth vs Fixed mindset</a> and how understanding this might help improve my learning and development. Looking at some of the qualities of the fixed mindset there are definitely certain things I tend towards - sometimes I will avoid a challenge if I'm uncertain I can complete it and there is visibility to others of how well I do. I also don't think I utilize constructive criticism as well as I should because I try and dismiss it too easily. Both of these things are hindering my ability to grow and learn. Part of my plan to progress is to embrace new challenges and try and see how I can utilize criticism more productively.</p>
