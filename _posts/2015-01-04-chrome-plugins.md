"Man is largely a creature of habit, and many of his activities are more or less automatic reflexes from the stimuli of his environment."
G. Stanley Hall

This post is a quick rundown of some tools I use to enhance productivity. The basic premise of these endeavors is that developing good habits is the key to a satisfying level of productivity.

First up is a nifty little plugin for chrome called webtimer.

Webtimer records the amount of time you spend on various websites and provides you with a nice little rundown:

The way I use this tool is both as a prompt to change behavior and as a measure of the effect of any changes I implement. 

For example the average amount of time I used to spend on dealing with email was around 80-120 minutes per week. Using this as my prompt I investigated if this was a) a good use of time i.e. was I wasting time deleting junk mail or was I getting lost in random emails when my focus should have been elsewhere and b) if there was any way to reduce the amount of time spent. 

Firstly I investigated several possible time-saving methods:

- immediately unsubscribing from unwanted mail, thereby reducing the repeated amount of time I had to click delete on unwanted email.

- deferring reading newsletters or longer emails for a more appropriate time. I.e. reading <a href="http://rubyweekly.com/">Ruby Weekly</a> while on the Bart or as Sunday night reading.

Having implemented them and reviewed the following weeks - the time spent dropped to roughly 50 minutes which was roughly 50% less, saving me roughly an hour a week and more importantly helping to develop new habits in how I deal with email.


#### <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/disable-extensions-tempor/lcfdefmogcogicollfebhgjiiakbjdje?hl=en">Disable Extensions Temporarily</a>

Another chrome plugin which is pretty simple - to switch off all chrome extensions temporarily. 

Typically when I'm working I don't want to be bothered with notifications from emails or my calendar but I have a lot of extensions installed in Chrome which intermittently disturb me. This provides a nice solution which allows me to click the power button and switch off all extensions temporarily. Once I'm done with my assigned task I can hit the power switch again to enable them once more.

This plugin can also be pretty useful for debugging browser issues such as slowness to eliminate any extensions as being the cause which is pretty sweet :)
