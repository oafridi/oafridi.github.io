<section class="about">

  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>This is the homepage of Osman Afridi. I am a Ruby on Rails developer.</p>

  <h4>A cursory intro...</h4>
  <p>
    I graduated in 2007 with a degree in computer science. Since then I've worked for the 68,000 person IT consultancy <a href="http://www.cgi.com/en" target="blank">CGI</a>, co-founded a 3 person startup <a href="http://www.matchnurse.com" target="blank">Matchnurse</a> and currently work for the 300+ person rapidly growing startup-come-huge-success-story <a href="http://www.atlassian.com" target="blank">Atlassian.</a>
  </p>

  <p>I wear a lot of hats and work across different tech stacks. Lately I've been interested in Ruby on rails and the Javascript space with a particular interest in backbone and node.js. Prior to that I worked with Java which was less than thrilling.</p>
  <p>Outside of tech I enjoy traveling and hope to get to explore each and every country in the world before time runs out - I've managed to travel to most continents excluding Africa and Antarctica which are next on the list. I'm also a huge bookworm but have a nasty obsessive compulsive habit of committing to books long after I lose interest. Other things I enjoy in no particular order - the music of Debussy, and Edvard Grieg, cups of tea, the Lion King, beans (Heinz - I can't stress this enough) on toast.</p>
  <p>I'm always wanting to work on cool projects and love collaborating so get in touch via the usual channels...</p>
