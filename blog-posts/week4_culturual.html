          <p>Its been coming up a lot lately - sexism in the tech world and more broadly under-representation of women in the world of tech. </p>

          <p>Currently I work at a software development company in the heart of San Francisco. Founded by two Aussies it was bootstrapped using credit card debt and grew to be a $5 billion company and the envy of thousands of startups. But there's something I noticed only the other day - there are only two female developers in an office with at least 30+ male developers. Why? Well first off the issue isn't specific to Atlassian. It's well known and well documented (do a google search, I'm too lazy to grab the stats) that this is a widespread issue that affects the entire industry. Fewer women are hired as developers or sit on the boards of the most prominent companies. </p>

          <p>Paul Graham and David Cohen who both run very well known incubators have both stated they believe it's a pipeline problem. That there simply isn't enough women going into technology. Which seems to be true - I did a quick look at the stats of women entering higher education taking Comp Sci degrees and it was significantly lower than males - see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_computing">here</a></p>

          <p>But is that all there is to it? That women just aren't interested in technology? Let's say for arguments sake that it is. Should we just accept this fact - why is it even a problem that there aren't more women in the tech industry? The answers are complex but I can relay an answer given to me by one of my female developer friends which illuminated at least one very real problem for me</p>

          <p>"When I was younger I loved playing with my dads computer and started programming when I was around 8. But when it came to university and choosing a course I visited the open day of my chosen university and spent the day attending classes. I felt so out of place. Everybody was male and there was a  perceptible machismo atmosphere. My friends kept joking about being a nerdy geek and even my mum told me it wasn't an 'attractive degree' - presumably to men. I ended up on the basis of that experience choosing to do a degree in English literature instead. That failed, I dropped out and eventually did get my degree in computer science." </p>

          <p>My friend's experience if far from being an isolated case.Certainly by appreciating my friends perspective I've become more aware of the problem and starting the dialog is the first step to addressing the issue. In Atlassian we started a side-by-side program to encourage us to raise our consciousness to become aware of the different experiences of each other and become more understanding of the differences therein. It's been an eye-opening experience and I think Atlassian are making a lot of the right moves in the right direction. I hope to see more in this space, and soon.</p>
