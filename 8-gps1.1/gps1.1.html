          <h2>What is Pair Programming?</h2>
          <p>Pair programing is a way for two people to work together on one problem on one computer. Each person has a defined role: one person navigates and provides instructions and the other drives and follows the instructions.</p>

            <h2>Why is Pair Programming Important to DBC?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Pair programming is a good way to catch bugs and prevent them from occurring</li>
                <li>With two people working on a problem it's easier to solve it because you have more ideas</li>
                <li>It is also a good way to learn from one another and to share knowledge about a code base</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            <h2>Driver vs Navigator</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The navigator will provide instructions and help navigate the way around solving a problem</li>
                <li>The driver will do the typing and implementing the instructions that the navigator provides</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

          <p>Pairing for the first time was both a lot of fun and very productive. Here's quick rundown of what worked and what didn't:

          <h5>What worked:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Having at least one person experienced in pairing. This prevents the awkward fumbling that occurs when neither party quite knows what to do.</li>
            <li>Having roles so that one person doesn't have to focus on typing and can catch typos and syntax errors</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>What didn't work so well</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>The only thing that didn't work is having a low familiarity with the tools we were using slowed us down and prevented us from making the full use of the time</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Overall I think pairing has a lot of benefits and its definitely a method I would use in future.</p>
