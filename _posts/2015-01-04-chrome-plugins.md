This post is a quick rundown of some tools I use to enhance productivity. First up is a nifty little plugin for chrome called webtimer.

What webtimer does is keep a record of the amount of time you spend on various websites.

#### <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/disable-extensions-tempor/lcfdefmogcogicollfebhgjiiakbjdje?hl=en">Disable Extensions Temporarily</a>

Another chrome plugin which is pretty simple - to switch off all chrome extensions temporarily. 

Typically when I'm working I don't want to be bothered with notifications from emails or my calendar but I have a lot of extensions installed in Chrome which intermittently disturb me. This provides a nice solution which allows me to click the power button and switch off all extensions temporarily. Once I'm done with my assigned task I can hit the power switch again to enable them once more.

This plugin can also be pretty useful for debugging browser issues such as slowness to eliminate any extensions as being the cause.
